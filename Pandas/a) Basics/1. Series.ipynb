    "## 1. What is Pandas:\n",
    "__Pandas__ is a __Python library__, specifically designed for data manipulation and analysis. So far we have explored the world of core Python and learnt about various objects like lists, strings and dictionaries. However, a vast amount of data in the world is stored and displayed in tables - there is not a single company in the world that hasn't 'indulged' in building a table in Excel!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### But why are Tables so important?\n",
    "\n",
    "A __table__ is a data structure that organizes information into rows and columns, used to store and display data in a structured format. Tables are used everywhere - tables in Maths are known under the term 'Matrix' (and whole field called Linear Algebra has emerged since 1694 revolving around it); tables are also a building block in databases; Chances are that everyone of us already 'consumed' some information today in the form of a table, purely because of how easy it is to deliver the 'meaning' behind a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the reasons why we use tables:\n",
    "- effortless data entry\n",
    "- automatic nomenclature: each cell is uniquely and easily identifiable\n",
    "- collection of vast quantitative data in an organised way\n",
    "- easy formatting, sorting and filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What does Pandas have to do with Tables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is the biggest Python 'weapon' in handling and exploring tables. As a Python library, it provides high-performance data structures and data analysis tools. The two main data structures in Pandas are:\n",
    "- Series\n",
    "- DataFrame\n"
